I came across many forms of psychoactive drugs, but I found particular interest in methadone, its frequent use and its unconventional dispensing method.\n\nMethadone is a synthetic painkiller used in a syrup-like form to treat and lessen withdrawal effects of opioid addiction. However, methadone is an opiate in and of itself, and due to its long-lasting effects (1-3 days) it could prolong addiction. For this reason, the pharmacy would generally be instructed to dispense small doses once a day and requires a signature log from the patient each time they receive a dose. Many other opioids, such as Kadian (morphine capsules) are also dispensed daily and require a pharmacist to sign off as a witness.\n\nThe opioid receptors in the brain bind to:\n-opiates (natural chemicals from opium poppies)\n-opioids (man-made chemicals)\n-endorphins (chemicals from the brain to reduce pain)\n\nOpioid receptors are widely distributed throughout the CNS, on peripheral neurons and the digestive track and trigger the reward system. The signals are sent through the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the nucleus accumbens and reaches the prefrontal cortex to activate a rewarding stimulus. Methadone binds to the opioid receptors and mimics the effects of naturally-produced endorphins as a way of “satisfying” the rush from opioids. Similar to an opioid, it also interrupts pain messages from the CNS but to reduce withdrawal symptoms. By gradually tapering or lowering the dose over time, the need for an endorphin rush decreases and eliminates opioid dependence.\n\nReferences: \nhttps://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/teaching-addiction-science/brain-actions-cocaine-opioids-marijuana\nhttps://americanaddictioncenters.org/methadone-addiction\";}s:11:\"coordinates\";O:8:\"stdClass\":2:{s:1:\"x\";d:8383.013916015625;s:1:\"y\";d:5554.352020263672;}s:11:\"permissions\";O:8:\"stdClass\":5:{s:6:\"public\";a:0:{}s:13:\"authenticated\";a:0:{}s:6:\"editor\";a:0:{}s:11:\"contributor\";a:0:{}s:10:\"subscriber\";a:0:{}}s:9:\"hideTitle\";b:0;s:12:\"hideProgress\";b:0;s:9:\"hideMedia\";b:0;s:9:\"skippable\";b:1;s:4:\"quiz\";a:0:{}s:10:\"fullscreen\";b:0;s:10:\"conditions\";a:0:{}s:13:\"childOrdering\";a:0:{}s:9:\"fitWindow\";b:1;}",

Myelin cells are surrounded by a lipid bi-layer held together by lamellae and do not contain cytoplasm (Susuki, K 2010) They are formed from Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and Oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. (Siegal, GJ et al 1999) In the PNS, one sheath is formed by one Schwann cell. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes produce multiple myelin sheaths. \n\n\tAxons can be myelinated or unmyelinated. The peripheral nervous system contains axons that are mostly myelinated while the central nervous system contains most of the axons in the body that are unmyelinated. This is because myelin increases the speed at which the impulse travels along the axon. This increased speed is needed for quick transfer of signal for motor function in the peripheral motor system to make longer distance is needed to travel to extremities (peace.saumag.edu 2020). \n\n??? ?????? ?????????\n\n      Because myelin is composed of a high number of lipids, it allows for insulation of the axon as lipids are nonpolar and have an exceptionally low attraction towards ions (Susuki, K 2010). Myelin also increases the distance between ions in the axon and extracellular ions. This prevents any ions needed for axon potential from leaking out into the extracellular fluid (Khan Academy 2016). The proper number of ions in a neuron needed for an action potential to fire must be maintained to allow for proper depolarization. If these ions were not maintained between Nodes of Ranvier, the electrical signal would not be passed on to the next node and the neuron would not function efficiently. \n\n????????? ??????????\n \n      In between each segment of myelin is an unmyelinated area called the Nodes of Ranvier. Nodes, as opposed to myelinated segments of axons, contain all the K+ and Na+ channels needed to allow for the reversal of membrane potential. Insulation allows for impulses to travel through the myelinated sheath to the next exposed area at the Nodes of Ranvier without needing to be regenerated in between which allows for ease of depolarization. This causes the signals to “jump” from node to node, therefore increasing the speed of conduction. This so-called “jumping” of signals is what is known as saltatory conduction. The signal does not actually jump, but instead activates ion channels in adjacent nodes down the axon (sciencedirect.com). \n\n????? ?????\n\n1.\tSiegel GJ, Agranoff BW, Albers RW, et al., editors.

Signs of biological aging includes shortening telomeres in which our chromosomes start fraying, senescent cells, and epigenetic-induced alterations in our DNA (refer back to methylation and histone).\n\nWe can slow down aging through maintaining a healthy lifestyle. While we are in our natural state, our body has enough energy conserved to focus on growing and reproducing, but in other cases, “survival” genes such as sirtuins, mTORs and AMPK can kick in to induce cellular repair and protection. We can create a similar scenario through maintaining a healthy diet, reducing protein intake, periodic fasting and high intensity work outs. Similarly, occasional changes in our environment and stepping out of our comfort zone can induce a similar effect.\n\nNow the question is: Is it possible to reverse aging?\nActually, studies that have been recently conducted in the past decade have shown signs of making breakthrough through arguably one of the greatest stem cell breakthrough since their discovery: the Yamanaka factors and the creation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS). \n\n[…Continue this topic be watching the related H5P content…]\n\nReferences:\nSinclair, D.

During this time, there were two main schools of thought: preformationism, which stated that cells had preformed elements which grew in size as the cell grew, and epigenesis, which thought that chemical reactions within the cell carried out an intricate developmental plan (Felsenfeld, 2014).\n\nThis development plan was supported by the discovery of DNA and chromosomes in cells, and eventually, the definition of epigenetics was modified in the past 50 years until its current definition: “the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence” (Riggs et al., 1996, as cited in Felsenfeld, 2014). At present, two major epigenetic mechanisms include histone remodelling and DNA methylation (Barnes, 2020). These changes do not affect the actual sequence of DNA, but the structures around the DNA, evidently shown in the name epigenetics, as the Greek prefix “epi-” roughly translates to “above” or “near” (Genetics, 2020).\n\nThe subject of transgenerational epigenetics concerns how epigenetic effects are transferred across generations. Studies have showed that environmental factors can influence mice and their behaviours for quite a few generations (Barnes, 2020). To better understand this idea, let’s turn to a similar idea proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck before Darwin’s theory of the evolution, now called Lamarckism.\n\n\nLamarckism\n\nLamarckism believed in the inheritance of “acquired traits,” which were traits gained through the experience of the organism. The conventional example that is used is the idea that giraffes developed long necks because during their lifetimes, they had to gradually stretch their necks to reach the leaves on higher and higher trees. This modification would then be subsequently passed down to the next generation of giraffes and so on, resulting in the overall increase in the lengths of giraffe necks (Michael, 2017).\n\nThis idea is incredibly similar to transgenerational epigenetics as it explores how the environmental is able to change the behaviour of subsequent generations. In the giraffe scenario, the pressure to extend your neck is analogous to the environmental effect in epigenetics.\n\nAlthough Lamarkism was eventually disregarded when Darwin’s theory of evolution came out, Darwin previously supported Lamarck’s ideas, incorporating it into his own theory. He proposed the idea of “gemmules”, which would modify the germline under environmental stress, effectively allowing the environment to have an effect on subsequent generations (Michael, 2017; Heard & Martienssen, 2014).\n\nTo end, one thing that I did find interesting during my research was that although there have not been very many concrete pieces of evidence for epigenetic inheritance in humans, our culture is quite Lamarckian-adjacent. We teach our children about certain ideas from our experiences with our environment which has the ability to change their behaviours, or phenotype (Heard & Martienssen, 2014). All in all, the similarities between transgenerational epigenetics and Lamarckism allow us to learn from their beliefs and clearly show how the past can resemble the present and even the future.\n\nBibiolography:\n\nBarnes, S.
